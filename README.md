# Functional Upper Limb Prosthesis controlled by Myo device

## Summary
A prosthesis, whether upper, lower or of any type, is a device used to totally or partially replace a part of the body, and which is placed to improve some of its functions or for aesthetic purposes. This project focuses on the control of a functional prosthesis of upper limb using the commercial Myo Armband device. This bracelet allows to obtain the myoelectric activity of the forearm, using dry electrodes, and the detection of gestures by movements, by means of inertial sensors. It has been evaluated in an amputated patient.

## Matherials and Methods
To carry out the project, a prosthesis has been made for a patient with an amputation below the elbow, printed in 3D. It is constituted by the Myo, a plug cone, a forearm that has a communication interface with the user, and a hand with five fingers that move independently. Inside the forearm, you will find the electronics and motors that manipulate the device.

The development of this project is carried out as follows:
In the first place, an investigation is carried out about the Myo device, its connection and communication characteristics through Bluetooth, and the information it processes and detects. In addition, the anatomy and physiology of the upper limb, the characteristics of myoelectric activity, and 3D printing and scanning technology are also analyzed.

Secondly, we proceed to the design and development of the prosthesis. A user needs assessment is performed, and the Myo device is evaluated on the amputee patient. Then the electromechanical system that commands the prosthesis is developed, with an interface that allows the user better control. The patient's arms are then scanned, and the socket cone, forearm, and hand are computer designed. Subsequently, we proceed to 3D printing and assembly of the prosthesis itself.

Finally, the performance of the device is evaluated, analyzing the response of the Myo device in the amputee patient, assessing the connection between the bracelet and the plate via Bluetooth, and the response of the prosthesis itself, as well as its functionality. As there is no device with similar characteristics, it is not possible to compare the results obtained.

## Results
The evaluations carried out show that it is possible to control a prosthesis from the Myo device, in an intuitive and simple way. In addition, it is feasible to apply this to a diverse number of people, with a functional and configurable anatomical design according to the user.
